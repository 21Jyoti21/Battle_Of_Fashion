For directly running our project just download the game-Copy.bat file , game.jar and you also need to install javafx-sdk-22.0.1 
from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ , download javafx-sdk-22.0.1 and save it in "Java" folder of your downloads
so the files should look like:

          -> game-Copy.bat
          -> game.jar
then run the bat file and you can play the project !
