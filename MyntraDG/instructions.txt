For directly running our project just download the game-Copy.bat file , game.jar and you also need to install javafx-sdk-22.0.1 
from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ , download javafx-sdk-22.0.1 and save it in "Java" folder of your downloads
so the files should look like:
Downloads -> Java-> //all files from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
          -> game-Copy.bat
          -> game.jar
then run the bat file and you can play the project !

other way is to download all the required files of Java: JDK22,JRE 8, javafx-sdk-22.0.1 [copy this it in Java folder and save it also in the folder where jar file is there] and setup the installations properly then run in terminal(vs code):
java --module-path Java\javafx-sdk-22.0.1\lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar game.jar


enjoy!!
